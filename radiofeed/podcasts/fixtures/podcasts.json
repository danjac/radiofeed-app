      "description": "What's CODE SWITCH? It's the fearless conversations about race that you've been waiting for! Hosted by journalists of color, our podcast tackles the subject of race head-on. We explore how it impacts every part of society — from politics and pop culture to history, sports and everything in between. This podcast makes ALL OF US part of the conversation — because we're all part of the story. \"We're talking to people who have been marginalized and underrepresented for so long, who are so hungry to see themselves represented fully and with nuance and complexity,\" says Shereen Marisol Meraji, co-host of Code Switch, Apple Podcasts' first-ever Show of the Year for 2020. \"People recognize that, because we had been having these conversations for so many years in advance, we're a trusted place where they could go to better understand all the stories about race filling up their newsfeeds and social channels.\" Their weekly podcast launched in 2016 but truly came into its own during this historic, transformative year, as Meraji and co-host Gene Demby examine issues of racial, ethnic, and cultural identity through frank one-on-one discussions and incisive non-fiction. In a year dominated by discourse about race, this indispensable show furthered them by providing powerful and timely insight, offering diverse and empathetic personal perspectives to a broad audience. \"There are certain lenses that we are bringing into, both as journalists and the people that we're bringing to these stories,\" Demby says. \"But also, we are specific people with specific fascinations and broad curiosity. If we're telling these stories, you should assume that they're going to look and sound like us.\"",

David Duke’s rise to power and prominence—his election to the Louisiana legislature, and then his campaigns for the U.S. Senate and the governorship—was an existential crisis for the state and the nation. The fourth season of Slate’s Slow Burn will explore how a Nazi sympathizer and former Klansman fashioned himself into a mainstream figure, and why some voters came to embrace his message. It will also examine how activists, journalists, and ordinary citizens confronted Duke’s candidacy, and what it took to stop him.",

It's a smart, unique (and admittedly U.S.-centric) program that doesn't dumb down the information or analysis for the slowest person in the room.\n\nCarlin's rapid-fire staccato voice has been compared to William Shatner after too many espressos. That, plus his penchant for making everyone in the audience mad at him eventually, makes for a witch's brew of a podcast that is not for everyone. But for those craving a deeper intellectual analysis, a less partisan approach and unpredictable outside-the-box revelations, Common Sense with Dan Carlin is a feast for the mind.",

And she's not the only one. Dozens of humans and mutants have gone missing, including the mother of a teenage boy, Marcus Baptiste. With Weapon X in close pursuit, Logan and Marcus must team up and follow a trail of clues that leads them deep into the gothic heart of the bayou, where they encounter biker gangs, Cajun thieves and a world of wonders that defies explanation. It is here that they find Greenhaven -- a refuge run by a powerful mutant named Jason Wyngarde. \n\n\n\nAward-winning comic book author Ben Percy (“The Dark Net,” “Red Moon”), director/sound designer Brendan Baker (“Wolverine: The Long Night”) and associate director/sound designer Chloe Prasinos (“Wolverine: The Long Night”) will return for the series, produced by Daniel Fink and Chloe Wilson of Marvel and Jenny Radelet Mast of Stitcher.

Along with a variety of guests and interviews, Mission Log will attempt to reach Star Trek’s ethical subtext, understand it’s complex metaphors and finally figure out what was the trouble with those tribbles.\n\nExplore strange new details.

But for most of his life, he was a mystery to the public, and to many of the people who knew him. In this six part series, we peel back the layers of Epstein’s life to detail his financial and sexual crimes, and his network of enablers, with original reporting and interviews. From humble beginnings, Epstein came to amass significant wealth which he used to buy sex, social status, silence, even justice —until money wasn’t enough.

What no one knew was that he was a prolific serial killer in the middle of a cross-country murder spree. In this six-part series, co-hosts Tracy Pattin (Hollywood &amp; Crime) and Stephen Lang (Avatar, Don’t Breathe) take listeners on an unbelievable journey into Alcala’s twisting secret life.&nbsp;He hid behind normal jobs as a typesetter at a prominent newspaper and a summer camp counselor. How did this predatory monster fool employers, prison psychiatrists, and parole boards — all while committing heinous crimes from coast to coast? And how did a one-time appearance as a game show contestant help lead to his capture? From the makers of Dirty John, Dr. Death, and Young Charlie, learn the story of the most famous serial killer you’ve never heard of - The Dating Game Killer.</p>",

With a deep, sometimes scary knowledge of the depths and intricacies of pop culture and the geek lifestyle, the conversations can spin off in many directions. While comics, graphic novels and trade paperbacks are the center of the iFanboy universe, the discussion often covers the video games, movies and TV shows which will capture the fancy of your regular comic book reader. Fun, intelligent, witty and entertaining, the iFanboy crew are just as likely to agree as argue about what's good and what's bad in superhero comics, indie comics, humorous comics, and important graphic novels as well as the creators, writers and artists behind them.  We've even occasionally been in the same room as guys like Brian Michael Bendis, Darwyn Cooke, Kurt Busiek, Warren Ellis, Jim Lee, Joe Quesada, Steve Dillon, Kevin Smith, Stan Lee and others.  It was a big room, but we were in it. This podcast is so good, you don't even need to read comic books to enjoy it, but it's a lot better if you do.",

      "description": "Set 17 years after the main events of WE’RE ALIVE, GOLDRUSH is a recollection story that describes the efforts of the “soldiers” (Greg Muldoon, Anthony Robbins, Carl Thomas, and Samuel Puck) attempt a side mission to retrieve a suspected stash of gold bullion.\n\nTold from the perspective of an aging Gen. Puck, he confides this previously undisclosed tale to the only surviving relation of his former team, Alex Robbins, the son of Puck’s friend Anthony. Over the course of ten episodes, the show will not only relate past tales of heroics, horror, and humor, but also sets the stage for future characters.\n\nIn Goldrush, fans will truly get to know these well-beloved characters characters on a much more emotionally satisfying level. Their humor and unique group dynamic certainly remain intact, and modeled after old Spaghetti Westerns, the story takes directions the series has not yet explored.\n\nFilled with action, battles with the undead, love triangles, conflicting loyalties, and of course gold, WE’RE ALIVE: GOLDRUSH stands out as a truly unique Theater for the Mind experience for both new and old listeners.",

      "description": "More often than we’d like to believe, people get away with murder. As cases grow cold, cops retire. Witnesses die. Evidence disappears. Unsolved, a true crime podcast series from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, guides listeners through these real-life mysteries, uncovering new clues along the way.\n\nSeason three of Unsolved tells the story of Father Alfred Kunz, whose throat was slit inside St. Michael School in 1998. Some believe his death was linked to his battles against evil. Others believe his all-too-human flaws were to blame.\n\nSeason two of Unsolved, released in 2017, examines the case of toddler Michelle Manders, who vanished from her bedroom in the middle of the night in 1981. Did she wander alone into the darkness? Or was she kidnapped?\n\nSeason one of Unsolved, released in 2015, explores the circumstances surrounding the death of 14-year-old John Zera, who disappeared from Franklin High School in 1976. The seven episodes follow investigators through decades of dead ends as they hold on to hope of finding the killer.\n\nSubscribe to Unsolved on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher Radio or wherever you get your podcasts.

How did the woman once heralded as \"the next Steve Jobs\" find herself facing criminal charges -- to which she pleaded not guilty -- and up to 20 years in jail? How did her technology, meant to revolutionize healthcare, potentially put millions of patients at risk? And how did so many smart people get it so wrong along the way? ABC News chief business, technology and economics correspondent Rebecca Jarvis, along with producers Taylor Dunn and Victoria Thompson, take listeners on a journey that includes a three-year-long investigation.

More than 70 years later, it remains America's most infamous unsolved murder. Many believe Dr. George Hodel was the killer, thanks to an investigation by Hodel's own son. But murder is just part of the Hodel family story, one filled with horrifying secrets that ripple across generations.  Now, through never-before-heard archival audio and first-time interviews, the Hodel family opens up to reveal their shocking story.  In this eight-part documentary series, sisters Rasha Pecoraro and Yvette Gentile, the great grand daughters of George Hodel, take a deep dive into their family history to try to figure out what really happened, and where do they all go from here? Root of Evil is the companion podcast to TNTs limited series I Am the Night. Inspired by the true story of the Hodel family, the series stars Chris Pine and comes from acclaimed Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins.",

      "description": "Dan Harris is a fidgety, skeptical ABC News anchor who had a panic attack live on \"Good Morning America,\" which led him to try something he always thought was ridiculous: meditation. He went on to write the bestselling book, \"10% Happier.\" In this podcast, Dan explores happiness (whatever that means) from all angles. Guests include legendary meditation teachers -- from the Dalai Lama to Western masters -- as well as scientists, and even the odd celebrity. But the show also ventures beyond meditation, bringing on leading researchers in areas such as social anxiety, bias, creativity, productivity, and relationships. The animating insight of this show is that the mind is trainable. This is what science is showing us. Mental traits such as happiness, calm, generosity, compassion, and connection are not hardwired, unalterable factory settings; they are, in fact, skills that can be trained. On this show, you'll learn how.",

His books include The End of Faith, Letter to a Christian Nation, The Moral Landscape, Free Will, Lying, Waking Up, and Islam and the Future of Tolerance (with Maajid Nawaz). The End of Faith won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction. His writing and public lectures cover a wide range of topics—neuroscience, moral philosophy, religion, meditation practice, human violence, rationality—but generally focus on how a growing understanding of ourselves and the world is changing our sense of how we should live. \n\nHarris's work has been published in more than 20 languages and has been discussed in The New York Times, Time, Scientific American, Nature, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, and many other journals. He has written for The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Economist, The Times (London), The Boston Globe, The Atlantic, The Annals of Neurology, and elsewhere.\n\nSam Harris received a degree in philosophy from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA.",

Since August 2006, hosts Warren (in Vancouver, BC) and Steven (in Edmonton, AB) have provided listeners with their brand of amusing Doctor Who praise and punishment. A year later, Chris (also in Edmonton, AB) was added to the team, and The Three Who Rule were born.\n\nRecommended by Doctor Who Magazine, Radio Free Skaro provides an entertaining and diverting listen for the diehard or casual Doctor Who fan. New episodes usually appear on Sundays, following a loose magazine format of the three hosts discussing the news and events of the past week in the worlds of Doctor Who, Torchwood, and the Sarah Jane Adventures. They have also recorded special commentary podcasts for classic series and new series episodes of Doctor Who along with interviews of some of the brightest of the Doctor Who luminaries. Radio Free Skaro is also the official podcast of Gallifrey One, the world’s largest and longest-running annual Doctor Who convention.",

Now, they're filling in the gaps by investigating wildly diverse areas of film through miniseries on topics like horror movies, documentaries and romantic comedies, with help from listeners' picks. Along the way, they’ll dissect iconic scenes, spotlight their favorite characters, and talk to some of the actors and directors who worked on these classics. And when Unspooled has built their own list of the best movies on earth, they'll blast them into space to be immortalized for eternity. Seriously.",

Along with host Ben Mankiewicz, Peter looks back on his life and tries to make sense of fame and failure. \"I'm Still Peter Bogdanovich\" is a remarkable story of loss, perseverance, and the solace of cinema.",

Specific details include: EXACT marketing methods used to find properties (Direct Mail, Cold Calling, PPC, Radio, Virtual Wholesaling, Bandit signs, etc), techniques for buying and selling the deals, next level negotiation and closing strategies, and even the exact dollar amount made on the deal! \n\nWhether you’re a newbie or a seasoned wholesaler, if you’ve ever thought about starting (or exploding) a wholesaling business, you are in the right place.\n\nCome be a fly on the wall and listen in on these conversations as we get our guest’s to spill their guts and share every juicy detail. It could be the only Podcast you ever need to listen to.",

His clients loved him. Fashion magazines profiled him. But as Brandt continued to build his empire—a best-selling product line, pristine homes in New York and Miami, and an absurd modern art collection—he was slowly becoming addicted to his own product. Popular speculation has it that it was Martin Short's scathing portrayal of a clearly-based-on-Brandt character in the 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt' that pushed him to his death, but the truth is far more complicated. From Justine Harman and the team behind 'Broken Harts.'",

My business is beauty, and this podcast allows me to take a deeper look at not only external beauty, but also beauty on a greater scale – the beauty that come from inside each of us. I like conversations that will stretch and challenge me. Some interviews will include hard conversations like infertility, racism and spirituality on many different levels, while others in the 'Act Casual' series may include uncomfortable, yet laughable topics about sex and dating. Obviously, because I am in Nashville and work in the country music industry, you will also find conversations with some of country music’s biggest stars such as Jason Aldean and Dierks Bentley and their wives. Ultimately, I am a curious person who loves learning about why we do what we do as people and why we are all really here.

On February 26, 2014, Christian Andreacchio was found dead in the upstairs bathroom of his apartment from a single gunshot wound to the head. After a mere 45-minute investigation, local police ruled his death a suicide, despite substantial evidence that points to Christian’s death not only being a homicide, but premeditated murder. Host Dennis Cooper investigates and shares a compelling story about this suspicious death, the questions surrounding it, and a grieving family’s ongoing fight for justice.",

Six volunteers are secluded in an imitation Mars habitat where they will work as imitation astronauts for one very real year.

Host Lynn Levy has been chronicling this experiment from the moment the crew set foot in their habitat, communicating with them through audio diaries that detail their discoveries, their frustrations, and their evolving and devolving relationships with each other.

      "description": "In a not so distant future, due to overwhelming carbon emissions, The Earth is on the brink of becoming uninhabitable. These conditions are made far more horrifying because the available housing shelters (that can produce sustainable air quality) will only be able to house 80% of the world’s total population. To try and save the human race, every person has a government-mandated microchip implanted in their brains to attempt to facilitate the migration of a portion of the population to an underground shelter. In order to decide who gets to be protected and who must stay above ground, the government implements a value scale they have determined based on “usefulness” to future society. If you are valued at a 50 or above, you will be chosen to enter the bunker, and, if not, you must stay above ground and face the end of days. “Neuron” (which acts as both a prestigious brain implant and also a software company) is folded into a sanctioned branch of the government called, “The Ministry of Experience.” Their job now is to develop technologies and software that can replicate the human experience above ground. But what is far more pressing is The Ministry must find a way to reduce the use of resources, or they will run out of all survivable assets before being able to relocate to “Eden” - the one place above ground that might be salvageable in a few years time. Whether Eden will be ready in time remains to be seen, but its existence is literally the last hope for the human race surviving. In a drastic effort to cut emissions and resource usage, “The Oyster” is created. The Oyster is Nirvana - A state absent from the mind while being filled with complete pleasure and bliss. What, then, happens when reality begins to fade and The Oyster is all that remains?\n\nThe Oyster stars Logan Browning (Dear White People and the Perfection), Mamoudou Athie (Jurassic World), Carla Gugino (Haunting of Hill House), Keith David (Greenleaf), Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad), Constance Zimmer (House of Cards, UnReal), Andrew Santino (Dave) and more.\n\nCreated by Alex Aldea and Adrienne Schaffler",

      "description": "Life's not easy for Doug Eiffel, the communications officer for the U.S.S. Hephaestus Research Station, currently on Day 448 of its orbit around red dwarf star Wolf 359. He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station. But the Hephaestus is an odd place, and life in extremely isolated, zero gravity conditions has a way of doing funny things to people's minds. Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that. Wolf 359 is a radio drama in the tradition of Golden Age of Radio shows. Take one part space-faring adventure, add one part character drama, and mix in one part absurdist sitcom, and you get Wolf 359. New episodes are released every two weeks.",

      "description": "A lighthearted conversation by  runners about their lives as runners and the issues that are interesting or important to them and guests of the show.  TJM is meant to be a companion to you as you run.  Think of us as your running partners on days when you just need some friends to get you out on an easy run.  The show is composed of 10 segments, one for each mile, and every 10 minutes or so we move on to the next topic, to keep things interesting.  Among the hosts' experience are ten 100-mile finishes, dozens of half and full marathons, plenty of 50-milers, and some speedy 5ks and a BQ (and a handful of DNFs).\n\nYour host, Scotty Kummer is an attorney, doberman owner and quite possibly the most painstakingly average runner known to man.  Scott has stumbled through numerous plus 4 and 5 hour marathons.  He's DNF'ed the 150 mile, 100 mile, 50 mile and marathon distance.  Okay, and he is a member of the Order of the Hrimthurs for having completed the Arrowhead 135, the Tuscobia 160 and the Actif Epica 120K in the same calendar year (more people have walked on the moon) as well as finshed 50+ ultramarathons including several 100 mile races.  He was once kicked out of an ultra runing group due to allegations of cyber-bullying.  He has a habit of offending people by accident while trying to help them.  He is a co-founder of the Flatlander Ultrarunners in Chicagoland which has rapidly grown to over 2000 members.  He came up with the idea for Ten Junk Miles after becoming frustrated with hearing interview after interview of Scott Jurek and deciding that runners needed more: more discussions of bathroom breaks that went wrong, pacer stories from hell, DNF reports, stories of getting lost on the trail and other related matters.\n\nMore at http://www.tenjunkmiles.com",

      "description": "In this podcast about all things Hamilton, Hamilton-related, Hamilton-adjacent, or anything else in the Miranda universe, I (your host Gillian Pensavalle) talk to guests (and my sometimes co-host/all times husband Michael Paul Smith) about such things as: how Hamilton brings people together, how we find Ham references in everyday life, and the general brilliance of the show. I'm proud to say that we've spoken to almost everyone from the original creative team (aka \"The Cabinet\") including the man himself: Lin-Manuel Miranda. In addition, I've had cast members from every company, crew members, musicians, creatives, and the hard working people that keep the production alive. I've also had to pleasure of speaking to experts on the show and its history, some of my superfan friends of note, celebrity Ham enthusiasts, and everything in between. \n\nWhen I started this podcast in January of 2016, I could not have imagined the incredible community that has grown around the show and the amazing experiences that have come my way. Thank you to everyone who has listened, appeared on the show, contributed, or reached out in any way. This podcast is for you and I absolutely love making it. \n\nIf you have any great Ham stories or funny references that you've come across, let me know! Email TheHamilcast [at] gmail [dot] com, or contact me on social media @TheHamilcast. I also have a Patreon that has given rise to the loveliest corner of the internet, ever.

      "description": "Congratulations, you've found the bravest podcast on the Internet! Now, let’s review the facts: there’s no such thing as good art and it’s a red flag for any adult to have a favorite band. Naturally, most of you will disagree with that statement. That's fine. If it helps, pretend the hosts are only playing a drinking game. Some algorithm randomly assigns a band to deconstruct and that's all Mark and Tyler are doing in every episode. Start with an easy one, some band everyone already knows is trash, like The Beatles or The Clash. Laugh along, “Hahaha! So funny... Yes...” With time, though, the realization is inevitable: this is a true crime podcast. Culture is a pyramid scheme and your favorite band is just the soundtrack to a fake vintage t-shirt. (Your favorite t-shirt also sucks, by the way. This podcast sells better shirts at shop.yfbspod.com because we care.) In the end, it all comes down to one question: can you find the inner strength it takes to press play and learn why Your Favorite Band Sucks?\n[REQUESTS? We only take them from subscribers, so smash the button and put that request in a 5-Star Review!]",

      "description": "In 1985, two Grateful Dead fans were brutally murdered. For the last three decades, rumors have circled around the Dead community that the wrong man was put in prison for it. One of the most iconic bands in American history, “The Dead” as they are affectionately called by their fans—self proclaimed \"Dead Heads”—have been dogged by a darkness that has followed them since its inception. Despite the Grateful Dead’s ethos of peace and love and communal music, this darkness has led to the murder and the disappearance of some of the band’s most dedicated fans. Hosted by popular podcasters Payne Lindsey of Up and Vanished and Jake Brennan of Disgraceland, this podcast combines the distinct storytelling styles of both Payne's investigative style and Jake’s single-voice narrative style. From Tenderfoot TV and Double Elvis, this is Dead and Gone, a long, strange, deadly trip.\nNew episodes every Thursday",

      "description": "Mogul is a show about hip hop’s most iconic moments, told by the people who lived them. Season 2 dives into the birth of southern hip hop. It all started in Miami with the 2 Live Crew, a group that took hip hop and made it faster, harder, and nastier than anything anyone had heard before. But in 1990 their music was declared legally obscene, and what followed is known today as the most controversial trial in the history of hip hop. This group, this city and this trial changed the course of music history as we know it. Mogul Season 2 features exclusive interviews with Miami legends like Trick Daddy, Rick Ross, Trina, Luke Campbell, Brother Marquis, Mr. Mixx, Walshy Fire, and more.",

      "description": "Want to hear a story? Country music is full of them, always with a killer soundtrack, sometimes a soundtrack made by a killer - like Spade Cooley, the only convicted murderer to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Or there’s the time Loretta Lynn released a song about birth control in the 1970s and everyone pretty much lost their minds. You’ve heard those? You sure? Millions of people think they know all about Merle Haggard’s 1969 song, “Okie from Muskogee,” but they’ve had it wrong the whole time. You’ll find those stories and others right here, obsessively researched, written and narrated by Tyler Mahan Coe, a lifelong veteran of country music and its mythology. Country music fans already know this is their new obsession but read the reviews and you’ll see how fast it’s catching on with listeners new to the genre. No other podcast is telling these stories, not like this. Start at the beginning. Press play. [If you aren't sure about the first episode, try Wynonna or the Kershaws. After that, though, you will want to return to the first episode and go from there. The show is constructed in seasons and episodes are presented in a careful order. You’ll find text transcripts of every episode at cocaineandrhinestones.com. Support the podcast for as little as $2 a month at patreon.com/tylermahancoe.]",

We look back on the festival 20 years later—and examine the legacy for Phish and the music world.

Each episode, we pick a short text and chat about it with some balance between insight and flippancy. You don't have to know any philosophy, or even to have read the text we're talking about to (mostly) follow and (hopefully) enjoy the discussion. For links to the texts we discuss and other info, check out www.partiallyexaminedlife.com.\n\nWe also feature episodes from other podcasts by our hosts to round out your partially examined life, including Pretty Much Pop (prettymuchpop.com, covering all media), Nakedly Examined Music (nakedlyexaminedmusic.com, deconstructing songs), and (sub)Text (lit, film, psychoanalysis).

But give us a listen and we may surprise you.   \n\nDanny, Kevin, Lee, & Eli explore various aspects of the ever-growing Disney Universe from an artist's point of view. We are also fans of the current podcasts that have established themselves in the Disney community and we hope to contribute alongside the well-established podcasters.   \n\nWe are a New Orleans based Disney fan podcast. Danny and Eli are visual artists, Kevin is a performing artist, and Lee..well, Lee is a travel agent \"artist.\" We hope to bring more attention to these two extremely important aspects of the Disney brand from the artists point of view. Along the way we will explore other topics as well.   \n\nPlease leave a review in iTunes and follow us on Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, & Pinterest.

AviatorCast bridges the gap between actual flight training and flight simulation to give prospective aviators, current pilots, and even the seasoned flyer new perspectives in aviation. <br />\n<br />\nThrough studying Human Factors we learn to combat the worst enemy to our flying success; ourselves. How can we become better aviators by interacting with our airplanes more effectively? How can we overcome the shortcomings of our human condition to make better decisions on the flight deck? <br />\n<br />\nWe believe in learning to a confidence level, not learning to a level required by law. When you get a license, you should be ready to go out and fly in those conditions, with those aircraft, and do so with refined skills. <br />\n<br />\nFlight simulators these days are very advanced, and we will discuss how you can sure up your flight training with a home based simulator, giving you limitless hours and practice in IFR with scenario based training. <br />\n<br />\nLearn how to fly, become better at your flying craft, mold into a safer pilot, or perfect your professional skills. <br />\n<br />\nAviatorCast is an engaging and entertaining podcast that is sure to deliver on the topics you care about.",

      "description": "Cast On began on Monday, 31 October, 2005, founded on nothing more than the desire to talk about knitting to people who get it. All the other stuff, about how memories, thoughts, hopes and dreams are knit into the fabric we create, and so become part of the fabric of our lives; about how life and knitting intertwine, and how sometimes you simply cannot tell where one part leaves off the other begins; about how the only thing wrong with the world today is that there is not enough knitting in it, all that came later, over time. Since 2005 the podcast has evolved to focus on finding inspiration in the ordinary, using it to kick start the process of making stuff, and finding ways to carve out the creative time and space that allows you to work your ass off on the projects that matter most to you. Like knitting a sweater. Or saving the world.",

Get to hear the personal Etsy stories behind your favorite Etsy shops as well as those you haven't yet discovered. it all began when a Turkish classical musician, a graphic designer, and an iPhone newbie/crafting geek all happily collided in the summer of 2013 in a happy conspiracy that birthed the new host and the revival of the Etsy Conversations Podcast. As an iPhone newbie trying to figure out what the funny-looking purple icon on her phone was, Ijeoma discovered a podcast that was in desperate need of life support. A few conversations, emails and two to five petite cups of Turkish apple tea later, the podcast went from the brink of obsolescence to becoming the watercooler hub for all things Etsy, handmade, and arts & crafts-related. The Etsy Conversations Podcast is the home of inspiring interviews with and for veteran and newbie Etsy sellers where you get tips, techniques, and tools to make you a better more successful Etsy seller by learning from other Etsy sellers.

In Season One, Friendship Album, 1933, tells a heart-warming story of strangers brought together by quilting and made into family. In Season Two, Dowell reads Aunt Jane of Kentucky by Eliza Calvert Hall. First published in 1907 and  set in rural western Kentucky in the late nineteenth century, the book recounts an elderly quilt-maker Aunt Jane’s memories of life in the rural south as told to an unnamed younger woman visitor. The book was hugely popular in its time, reaching over a million readers, and President Theodore Roosevelt was one of Aunt Jane’s biggest fans.",

This is the podcast with easy-to-understand resources, tips, and information to help beginning gardeners get the most out of their gardening adventure -- big or small. When I began gardening in 2013, I scoured books and Internet resources to find all the information I could. Although good information was abundant, I had trouble understanding all the gardening lingo and sifting through the information to figure out what would work for me. In this podcast, my aim is to provide helpful information while explaining the gardening lingo as we go. I want to equip YOU to have the best start ever this gardening season!",

We talk about the latest movies in MARVEL like Avengers: Endgame, DC  and STAR WARS.  But we also cover other blockbusters and don't shy away from indie films as well.  We breakdown and discuss new trailers for upcoming movies.  And we got you covered in television with shows like Black Mirror, Perpetual Grace LTD, Wayne, Cobra Kai, Stranger Things, The Mandalorian, Fleabag, Westworld, Dead To Me, The Walking Dead and more.  We love to review the first episodes of most shows and let you know if it's worth your time. So strap yourself in and have a good time!   Strap yourself in?  Really?  Just listen.

The Boston Globe’s Spotlight Team, best known for its investigation of the sexual abuse scandal inside the Catholic Church, takes a hard look at the crisis facing football through the lens of Aaron Hernandez’s life and terrible crimes.</p><p>From Wondery, the podcast team that brought you Dr. Death, Spotlight asks: Did a brain badly damaged by football contribute to Hernandez’s violent behavior? Did he keep secrets about his sexuality that collided with a hyper-masculine football culture? Did elite coaches and teams look the other way as Hernandez was spiraling out of control?</p><p>Spotlight uncovered new documents, audio, and interviews to go deep into the story of what happened to Aaron Hernandez, and what it means for those of us who cheer on a violent game.&nbsp;</p>",

In 2004, Freddy Adu joined MLS at 14 years old, becoming the youngest American pro team sport athlete in 100 years. His story is a tale of talent, money, fame and fútbol. Journalist Grant Wahl, who covered Freddy and LeBron James in their teens, retraces the legend of Freddy as he went from superstar to one of the biggest \"what ifs,\" asking: What determines who \"makes it\" and who \"doesn't\"? And what does it say about our cultural obsession with the potential of young athletic genius?",

How did the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup save English soccer from falling apart? And how did one player turn a free-kick into an act of protest? This series from Gimlet Media is an homage to the triumph and heartbreak, victory and defeat that we all experience from soccer (or football, or futbol, or whatever you call it). And it reminds us that so much of what we love about the beautiful game happens off the pitch.",

Nothing will be off limits and no stone will be left unturned! You’ll hear the hosts debate whether or not it’s kosher to try doubles opponents, if the unhand serve (ala Nick Kyrgios) is a smart play or disrespectful, how well they think they would fare against Serena Williams, the biggest mistakes tennis parents make, and much, much more!

Each week Conrad Thompson will examine Arn’s days in the territories, becoming an Anderson, creating the Four Horsemen in the NWA, becoming a Hall of Famer, and being a producer behind the scenes for years for WWE proving “The Enforcer” has a story unlike anyone else. Known for his trademark Spinebuster and incredible “promos” in front of the camera, it’s his timing and wit that has kept “the boys” in stitches behind the scenes.

      "description": "The Song Celestial unfolds a dialogue of the advice given by an avatar or God incarnate. The recipient of the message is Arjuna, the prototype of the struggling human soul who is ready to receive the great knowledge by his close companionship and increasing nearness to the divine Self within himself. \r\r\r\r\rThis symbolic companionship of Krishna and Arjuna, the divine and the human soul is further dramatized by the fact that their dialogue takes place amidst the din and clamor of a battlefield. The teacher in the Gita is therefore not only the God who is transcendent but also the God in man who unveils Himself through an increasing knowledge... \r                                                                     Vanamali, Nitya Yoga.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rAldous Huxley, asserts that ‘The Bhagavad Gita occupies an intermediate position between scripture and theology; for it combines the poetical qualities of the first with the clear-cut methodicalness of the second. ‘The book may be described’ writes Ananda K. Coomaraswamy in his admirable Hinduism and Buddhism, ‘as a compendium of the whole doctrine to be found in the earlier Vedas, Brahmanas and Upanishads, and being therefore the basis of all the The later developments, it can be regarded as the focus of all Indian religion...\r\r...But this focus of Indian religion is also one of the clearest and most comprehensive summaries of the perennial philosophy ever to have been made. Hence its enduring value, not only for Indians, but for all mankind’.\r\rThe Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) offers an understanding of The Great Mystery, which has inspired many of the giants of the Western intellectual tradition. The transcendentalist poets Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman were students of The Bhagavad Gita. Thoreau wrote: ‘In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous cosmological philosophy of The Bhagavad Gita, in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.’\r\rEmerson, referring to the Gita, wrote: ‘It was the first of books. It was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age . . . had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.’\r\rThis is a series of discourses on the liberating teachings of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) by Mataji (Mother) Vanamali, Vanamali Gita Yogasram, Rishikesh, North India.\r\rVanamali Mataji is the author of The Lila Hindu World Heritage Library. Her books include: a translation of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, Nitya Yoga, a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,  Sri Krishna Lila, Sri Rama Lila, Sri Shiva Lila, Sri Devi Lila, Sri Hanuman Lila, Lilas of the Sons of Shiva, Gurudeva  and The Taste Divine. Sri Devi Lila is published in the U.S. as  Shakti: Realm of The Divine Mother , Sri Hanuman Lila  as  Hanuman: The Devotion and Power of The Monkey God.\r\rEach talk is introduced with the Sanskrit invocations and chanting of the Gita chapter. Then Mataji Vanamali offers a line-by-line illumination of Shri Krishna's liberating teachings.\r\rWe invite you to visit our website: www.Vanamaliashram.org\rand enjoy our Pilgrims Guide, Discourses and Book &amp; Music store.",

I bet we will laugh a lot and cry a little and learn a lot and grow so much as we dive into the Book of Mormon this year.  I think Heavenly Father just whispered to all of us, \"Come follow my Son this year.  It's going to be so great!\"  And then he handed us this gift.  Let's not take Come Follow Me for granted.  Let's get out of it all that we can.  \nI don't know a lot about much, but I do know that I love my Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the scriptures so much and hope that I can pass a little of that love on to you.  It really is the best feeling in the world.",

When a murderer starts killing off those in attendance, the guests must figure out who is responsible, or at least how to stay alive -- lest they be next.\n\nDeadly Manners was created by Ali Garfinkel and Alex Aldea.\n\nDeadly Manners stars Kristen Bell, Denis O'Hare, Alisha Boe, RuPaul, Anna Chlumsky, Timothy Simons, Michelle Visage, Alona Tal, David Cummings and is narrated by LeVar Burton.\n\nArtwork by Kina Lee.",

      "description": "A show about clinical depression...with laughs? Well, yeah. Depression is an incredibly common and isolating disease experienced by millions, yet often stigmatized by society. The Hilarious World of Depression is a series of frank, moving, and, yes, funny conversations with top comedians who have dealt with this disease, hosted by veteran humorist and public radio host John Moe. Join guests such as Maria Bamford, Paul F. Tompkins, Andy Richter, and Jen Kirkman to learn how they’ve dealt with depression and managed to laugh along the way. If you have not met the disease personally, it’s almost certain that someone you know has, whether it’s a friend, family member, colleague, or neighbor. Depression is a vicious cycle of solitude and stigma that leaves people miserable and sometimes dead. Frankly, we’re not going to put up with that anymore. The Hilarious World of Depression is not medical treatment and should not be seen as a substitute for therapy or medication. But it is a chance to gain some insight, have a few laughs, and realize that people with depression are not alone and that together, we can all feel a bit better. American Public Media and HealthPartners’ Make It Okay campaign are committed to breaking the stigma around mental health.",

      "description": "<p>Is it just me or is time flying by? How do we make the most out of our short time here on Earth? That’s what we’re here to find out. I’m Justin Long and I’ve been an actor for most of my life, so I’m used to getting inside the heads of the characters I play. But now that I’m getting older (I’m 41 now, yikes), I want to peek inside the heads of real people to learn how they find meaning in life. I’m also very curious what their favorite snack food is, and what emoji they use most often — ya know, the REALLY important stuff. Every episode I’ll get personal with all kinds of people, from actors to musicians to deep thinkers who fascinate me. My brother Christian is on hand each episode to keep me honest, and occasionally remind me about some of the embarrassing things I’ve done over the years. Join us, or if you have more important things to do, that’s okay too — life is short! </p>",
