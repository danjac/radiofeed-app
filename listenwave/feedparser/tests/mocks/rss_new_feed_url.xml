<title>The Westall UFO Incident</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>On the morning of April 6th, 1966, in the Melbourne suburb of Clayton South, hundreds of schoolchildren were enjoying their morning recess when the ordinary became extraordinary. Over the playing fields of Westall High School, a strange silver disc appeared in the sky, silent, gleaming, and moving in ways no aircraft should. Within minutes, one of Australia’s most intriguing UFO mysteries had begun.</p><p>In this episode, we explore what really happened on that clear autumn day when a whole school witnessed something unexplainable. Students described a metallic disc-shaped object, round with a domed top, gliding across the sky and descending toward a nearby open field known as The Grange Reserve. Some said it landed. Others said it hovered just above the ground before shooting away at incredible speed. And hovering above it all, literally, were several light aircraft, seemingly chasing or circling the mysterious object.</p><p>More than 200 people, students, teachers, and locals, witnessed the event. Their accounts, though varied in detail, shared a striking consistency: a strange object, a sudden descent, and a rapid, silent departure. In the minutes after it vanished, several students raced to The Grange and found a circular patch of flattened grass, as if something heavy or hot had pressed down upon it. One girl reportedly fainted at the site and was carried away by ambulance, a name that would later vanish from the school’s records.</p><p>Then, the men in suits arrived.</p><p>Witnesses recall that uniformed officers and possible air-force personnel showed up soon after. Teachers were told not to speak to the media, and students remember their headmaster warning them to stay silent. But the story leaked anyway. Local papers ran headlines like <i>“Flying Saucer Mystery: School Silent.”</i> Reporters came knocking, and for a short while, Melbourne buzzed with talk of flying saucers over the suburbs.</p><p>The official explanations came quickly: it must have been a weather balloon, or perhaps a secret military experiment. Some researchers later suggested the HIBAL project, a Cold War program using large silver balloons to monitor radiation, could have been responsible. But no HIBAL launches were logged near Melbourne that day, and witnesses insisted what they saw moved with purpose and speed, nothing like a drifting balloon.</p><p>Almost six decades later, the Westall UFO incident remains Australia’s largest mass sighting of an unidentified flying object. No official report has ever surfaced, and the mystery has only deepened with time. The children who once looked up from their schoolyard are now adults, still wondering what it was they saw that morning, and why they were told to forget.</p> <p><p><a href="https://www.pastliveshypnosis.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://www.pastliveshypnosis.co.uk/</a><br><br><a href="https://www.patreon.com/alienufopodcast" target="_blank">https://www.patreon.com/alienufopodcast</a></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXKRGDFP">My book 'Verified Near Death Exeriences' https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXKRGDFP</a></p></p><br/> <p>Hosted by Simplecast, an AdsWizz company.
