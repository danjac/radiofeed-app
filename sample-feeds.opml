                text="尊敬的听友们，您好，这里是《听学编程之python》的音频节目。 阿拉伯数字编号的『主系列』以硬核，高级抽象，探究机理深，课程时间长，消耗精力大为特点，适合于对程序开发有兴趣的，以探求极致为目的Geeker。 汉字数字编号的『小白系列』以干货，实操和快速掌握为特点，提供愉快的学习体验，循序渐进的技术路线，急用先学，实用了解，适合于无基础的在工作中的Python实用者。 最新研究表明，编程能力是由高级抽象的直觉思维，获取信息的方法途径和组织代码编写速度三个部分组成，而思维对编程能力的影响是最关键的。我们都想要升职加薪，想要在公司中获得尊重，不去提高本领和能力，不想着改进学习和工作效率，走任何邪门歪道，那都是痴心妄想。遗憾的是，身边所见学习一门新的编程语言时，大量宝贵的时间和精力，都浪费在无穷的资料和海量的代码中了，认知水平不提高，程序员永远都是在搬砖。听学编程是唯一有效的学习方式，在地铁里，公交上，散步中，不浪费时间，不消耗精力，是闭着眼睛都可以学习的高效方式，让你的编程学习事半而功倍。而且，和各种在线培训网站不同，我们的课程是免费的哦。"
