# PostgreSQL volume configuration
# This role expects the postgres_volume variable to be defined in hosts.yml
# Example in hosts.yml:
#   postgres_volume: /mnt/HC_Volume_104566943
#
# The volume path should point to a mounted block storage volume
# (e.g., Hetzner Cloud Volume) that is attached to the database node.
#
# For Hetzner Cloud volumes, ensure the volume is:
# 1. Created in the Hetzner Cloud console
# 2. Attached to the database server
# 3. The path here should be where you want it mounted (e.g., /mnt/HC_Volume_104566943)
#
# This role will:
# - Create the directory with proper permissions
# - Set ownership to UID/GID 999 (PostgreSQL user in container)
# - Set permissions to 0700 (required by PostgreSQL)
